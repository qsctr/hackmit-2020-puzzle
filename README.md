# hackmit-2020-puzzle

Our solutions to the HackMIT 2020 puzzle. This repository contains the code and instructions for solving each puzzle. We didn't write up complete walkthroughs for how each puzzle works and the process of how we figured out the solutions, but HackMIT will release a blog post soon with their walkthroughs, and how our solutions work should be (somewhat?) evident from reading the code. We also wrote several puzzle 5 interpreters for fun.
